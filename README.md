# Advent of Code 2021 (aoc-2021-rust)
Solutions to Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2021), coded as part of my efforts to learn Rust

Run code by specifying the AOC day and part to be solved, together with the input data file, e.g., to solve Day 1, Part 2: cargo run data/day1-input.txt 1 2

 * **Day 1:** "Sonar Sweep" - iteration, simple comparison and exhaustive search (aoc_day1_solver.rs)
 * **Day 2:** "Dive!" - iteration and simple arithmetic (aoc_day2_solver.rs)
 * **Day 3:** "Binary diagnostic" - iteration, frequency computation, binary conversion (aoc_day3_solver.rs)
